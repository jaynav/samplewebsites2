<h2>What has javier done?</h2>
</div>
<p>well javier is currently active in local community service in the form of graffiti cleanup around his local neighborhood. this is done by several methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>cleaning it up with special graffiti removal.</li>
<li>calling code enforcement.</li>
</ul>
<p>other things that javier does to keep his neigborhood safe for everyone is:</p>
<ul>
<li>call code enforcement on neigbors when:
<ul>
<li>neighbors tick javier off</li>
<li>when something has been sitting there too long and it has a ton of spider webs</li>
<li>lowers property value</li>
<li>just because javier hates some of his neighbors</li>
<li>unkept lawns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="centerwords">
<h2>does javier do anything else besides ticking off neighbors?</h2>
<h3>of course he does. do you think that he is that evil to only do that?</h3>
</div>
<p>javier's special hobby mostly revolves around riding a bike.(but his currentweight does not show it).</p>
<p>the two forms of bike riding for javier are</p>
<ul>
<li>going downhill on mountain trails at about 35MPH.</li>
<li>riding a bike on surface streets.
<ul>
<li>javier's maximum distance that he has gone is 70 miles in one bike ride.
<ul>
<li>it was from San Bernadino to Glendora and back</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>other stuff that javier does is be cheap and stingy.</p>
<ul>
<li>if you give javier 20 dollars, at the begining of the month, chances are that at the end of the second month, he still will have those 20 dollars.</li>
<li>he would rather walk 5 miles to go to a store rather than drive in order to save gas money even though it will take him about 2 hours to get there.</li>
</ul>
