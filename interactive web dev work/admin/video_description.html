<h3>where the video is located?</h3>
<p>first the video is located in the planner page in my website just in case you need to know the exact location of the page</p>
<h3>what the video was about? and reason why did you make it this way?</h3>
<p>my video was made in three scenes. the first scene was an introduction that was trying to show the user that </p>
<p>working all day in a daily pattern can get boring, this was followed by the transition into showing pictures of places</p>
<p>that one can go to get away from the routine. this transistions into the third scene were the user is promted to leave and take off</p>
<p>and explore the southern california region. the reason that i made it this way was based on the recomendation that i was giving based on the critique of my story board</p>
<p>this promted me to make my video in a more commercial like type of way</p>
<h3>well whats so complex about it?</h3>
<p>well for me, i found it a bit hard to get that cinematic commercial effect that i was aiming for.</p>
<p>part of it was getting the correct music. after spening 3 hours sampling free music, i had to</p>
<ul>
  <li>go over the music and cut out part of the song in order to get the effect that i wanted  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>had to splice the music in the correct format so it sounds that the music is not cut out in multiple sections. making it sound flawless was very hard to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>chosing the right pictures. this was hard because not all pictures were qualified for good transition effect  </p>
<ul>
  <li>making transitions of the pitures, this was hard because i decided to use different transition effects  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>the transiton effects proved to be a pain because getting the correct timing of the transitons proved to be critical to getting for the cinematic effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the embeded captions transitons were the biggest issue in my case. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>the embeded captions were difficult because when i originally set them up, i set them to just go with each video clip and photo clip. But i wanted again to have that cinematic effect and having each embeded caption transiton to go partially into the next video/picture. in order to get this to work the way that i wanted, i had to use the video transions effects. in order to get each clip to partially transiton into the next video clip. this was a simillar process that i used for the pictures transitons.</p>
  <h3>so what was the hardest part of this process?</h3>
  <p>the hardest part of the process was getting the timing correctly. i did the best i could to get close to the cinematic commercial effect that i was hoping to get. i like how it came out since it goes with my site.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>oh. ok. so how long did it take you?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>it actually took me a long time, to do the transitoning between frames. with the embeded caption, it took me 5 hours to do just the video.</li>
  <li>music sampling, and music editing took me another 3 hours.</li>
  <li>the external xml captioning took me 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>wow you took 8 hours in total... so how long is your video?</h3>
<p>well....not that long its about two minutes long, its that i am not used to premire pro. and im slow too.</p>
